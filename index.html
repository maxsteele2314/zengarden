    What makes Zen Garden interesting?
  </h4>
  
  <p>
    The Zen Garden is a webpage where creative computer scientist can show off their CSS abilities without having to write actual 
    HTML content. It's a place where both highly trained professionals as well as newcomers can pratice refining their abiltites 
    while also creating a beautiul interconnecting webpage that links completly diffrent CSS to the same HTML format. I think it's
    incredible when you switch from diffrent CSS to diffrent CSS repeatedly. Through the first few times reading the content it feels 
    as if your reading another text because it is presented in such a diffrent way then the one page before it. I think the Zen Garden
    is an overall art masterpiece while also requiring the skills of both HtML and especially CSS.
